## An Automator stuff for quickfix text from context menu (or with hotkey) which was typed on wrong keyboard layout.

When I'm coding and suddenly "pingg... pingg, pingg", someone writes to me on messenger, I just quickly swipe my screen and start to answer. But. I'm trying to write hungarian words with english keyboard layout and usually I notice this after a half page... 😩 This is a reason of this tool.

**It's working at:**

- U.S. International🇺🇸 --> Hungarian🇭🇺 (not Hungarian-QWERTY)

...but contributions are welcome.

## Quick install

1. Download zip from [here](https://github.com/munkacsimark/hunglish-text-converter/releases/latest) and unzip it.
2. From unzipped folder copy `hunglish text converter.workflow` to `/Users/<username>/Library/Services`. (⚠️ change the "username" to yours)
3. Calm down and use it. 🌈

## Contribute or "prouser" install

Comming soon...

spoiler: it's just a python script written in Automator.

## How to use

1. After installing it: `select wrong text > right click > services > hunglish text converter`
2. (optional) Assing a hotkey to it: `System Prefs > keyboard > shortcuts > services`

## Examples

- ``'rv`yt\r[ t-k0rf]r=g;p`` --> `árvíztűrő tükörfúrógép`
- `>D` --> `:D`
- `<<<`--> `???`
